# Resourceful

Resourceful is a set of tools focused primarily on building web-based APIs in a
RESTful manner.

For the time being it's designed to solve problems on a specific API, but the
design goal is to keep it generic enough to useful outside of a single project.

Incidentally, this is my first Elixir package so... keep that in mind.

I imagine this will get bigger as the library grows.
